Online Contact Directory

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is web application used to store contacts online. In project 1 we had created notepad app which
stores information in the indexeddb. This inspired me to come up with this app where users can add,
view, edit or delete contacts. This is a very simple app which is developed in ReactJS. There are options to input information such as name, contact number, email address and contact’s image. It also facilitates CRUD operation. The data is stored in Firebase Data store.
Features and Functionality

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functionality
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a ReactJS web application which I developed and styled using the Bootstrap CSS Framework The application reads the input from html form elements and stores it on Firebase data store with unique id. Unique id is used when you want to delete or update a contact. I made use of Gulp for compiling and task management.

I designed the application using the Bootstrap framework which lets us build mobile friendly web
application with its built in libraries.
